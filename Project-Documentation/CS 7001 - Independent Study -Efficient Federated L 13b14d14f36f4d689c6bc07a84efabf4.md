# CS 7001 - Independent Study -Efficient Federated Learning

# **Intro and** **Definitions**

- Federated learning **enables multiple actors to build a common, robust machine learning model without sharing data**, thus allowing to address critical issues such as data privacy, data security, data access rights and access to heterogeneous data.
- Federated learning (FL) has been a popular method to achieve distributed machine learning among numerous devices without sharing their data to a cloud server.
- Federated learning aims at training a machine learning algorithm, for instance deep [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network), on multiple local datasets contained in local nodes without explicitly exchanging data samples. The general principle consists in training local models on local data samples and exchanging [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameters_(computer_science)) (e.g. the weights and biases of a deep neural network) between these local nodes at some frequency to generate a global model shared by all nodes.
